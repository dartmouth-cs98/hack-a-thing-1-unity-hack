# My Platform Game

Here is the link to my game: https://connect.unity.com/mg/2d/untitled-25881

I attempted to follow the unity platform tutorials found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template

I worked by myself. I went through the tutorials and tried all the mods. After finishing the mods, I started to build my own game from scratch, but did not get too far on that.

Coming into this hack, I knew nothing about unity. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. To be honest, it felt less like coding and more like the program "Scratch" I used when younger.
