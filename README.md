# My Platform Game

Here is the link to my game: https://connect.unity.com/mg/2d/untitled-25881

I attempted to follow the unity platform tutorials found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template

I worked by myself. I went through the tutorials and tried all the mods. After finishing the mods, I started to build my own game from nothing, but did not get too far on that.

Coming into this hack, I knew nothing about unity. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. To be honest, it felt less like coding and more like the program "Scratch" I used when younger.
After the initial struggle of setting up Unity, especially with github, the tutorials were straightforward and it was easy to use. I've always been interested in game design and Unity just makes that easier!
